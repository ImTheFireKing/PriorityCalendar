Based on the priority of things, I could then make recommendations for what must be done in order to help stay on top of everything without having to juggle thinking about all of that in a person's head.

#### Classes
Despite coding the backend in Python, I implemented OOP into a large majority of my design. I used lessons from my programming languages course to slowly build up smaller objects that serve a purpose for
